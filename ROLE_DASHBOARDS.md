## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Role-Specific Color Schemes
Each dashboard uses colors that represent its purpose:
- **Admin**: Default (authority, control)
- **Kitchen**: Orange (heat, cooking, urgency)
- **Waiter**: Blue (service, calm, hospitality)
- **Cashier**: Green (money, transactions)
- **Driver**: Blue (delivery, movement)
- **Customer**: Default (friendly, accessible)

### Task-Focused Interface
Each dashboard shows **only** what that role needs:
- No unnecessary features
- No confusing options
- Clear, actionable tasks
- Quick access to common actions

### Mobile Responsive
All dashboards work on:
- Desktop (full features)
- Tablet (optimized layout)
- Mobile (touch-friendly, simplified)

---

## 🔒 Security & Access Control

### Role Verification
Each dashboard checks user role in the loader:
```javascript
if (!user || user.role !== 'COOK') {
  throw redirect("/");  // Not authorized
}
```

### Benefits:
✅ Users can only access their dashboard  
✅ No sensitive data exposure  
✅ Clear role boundaries  
✅ Automatic redirects for unauthorized access
