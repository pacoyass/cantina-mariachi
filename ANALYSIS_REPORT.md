- ~~Medium: Vite middleware file serving issues~~
- **Status**: Fixed via `npm audit fix`

### 2. **Logging & Monitoring**
- 🔧 **Issue**: Inconsistent logging - mix of console.log/warn/error and LoggerService
- 🔧 **Issue**: Redis warnings flooding test output
- **Impact**: Debugging difficulties, log noise in tests
- **Priority**: Medium

### 3. **Code Quality Issues**
- 🔧 **Issue**: Low coverage in key areas:
  - authService.js: 52% statement coverage
  - translation.js: 15.78% statement coverage
  - response.js: 60% statement coverage
- **Impact**: Potential bugs in critical authentication and utility functions
- **Priority**: High

### 4. **Performance Concerns**
- 🔧 **Issue**: Database connection not optimized for test environment
- 🔧 **Issue**: Redis connection warnings in test environment
- **Impact**: Slower test execution, resource waste
- **Priority**: Medium

### 5. **Configuration & Environment**
- 🔧 **Issue**: Missing .env file (only .env.example exists)
- 🔧 **Issue**: Database URL points to PostgreSQL but using SQLite in dev
- **Impact**: Configuration inconsistencies
- **Priority**: Low

### 6. **Deprecated Dependencies**
- 🔧 **Issue**: Several deprecated packages:
  - crypto@1.0.1 (built into Node.js)
  - inflight@1.0.6 (memory leaks)
  - node-domexception@1.0.0
  - glob@7.2.3
- **Impact**: Security risks, maintenance burden
- **Priority**: Medium

## 📊 Test Coverage Analysis

### High Coverage (>80%)
- Controllers: 82.87% (well tested)
- Middleware: 79.2% (good coverage)
- Validations: 100% (excellent)

### Medium Coverage (60-80%)
- Services: 72.45% (needs improvement)
- Config: 60% (acceptable)

### Low Coverage (<60%)
- Utils: 59.43% (critical utilities undertested)
  - translation.js: 15.78% (very low)
  - response.js: 60% (important utility)
  - logger.js: 60% (critical service)

## 🚀 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Improve Test Coverage**: Focus on authService, translation utils, and response helpers
2. **Fix Logging**: Replace all console.* calls with LoggerService
3. **Clean Up Dependencies**: Remove deprecated packages

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
1. **Optimize Test Environment**: Fix Redis warnings in tests
2. **Database Configuration**: Align database URLs and configurations
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add more comprehensive metrics

### Long Term (Low Priority)
1. **Documentation**: Expand API documentation and developer guides
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated testing and deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Add application performance monitoring (APM)
