# Order Processing Workflow Improvements

## Overview
Complete redesign of the order processing workflow based on cashier-centric coordination. The new flow ensures proper handoffs between cashier, kitchen, and driver with clear status tracking.

## New 6-Step Order Workflow

### The Complete Flow
```
PENDING → CONFIRMED → PREPARING → READY → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED → COMPLETED
```

### Detailed Steps

#### STEP 1: Client Places Order → Cashier Confirms (PENDING → CONFIRMED)
- **Who**: Cashier
- **What**: Cashier sees all new orders made by clients
- **Action**: Reviews order details and confirms or rejects
- **Purpose**: Quality control and validation before kitchen starts

#### STEP 2: Cashier Sends to Kitchen (CONFIRMED → PREPARING)
- **Who**: Cashier
- **What**: Physically hands the confirmed order to kitchen
- **Action**: Sends order to kitchen preparation
- **Purpose**: Physical handoff ensures kitchen has the order

#### STEP 3: Kitchen Prepares (PREPARING → READY)
- **Who**: Kitchen/Cashier
- **What**: Kitchen prepares the food
- **Action**: When kitchen finishes, cashier marks as ready
- **Purpose**: Indicates order is complete and ready for pickup

#### STEP 4: Cashier Assigns Driver (READY → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY)
- **Who**: Cashier
- **What**: Selects available driver for delivery
- **Action**: Assigns driver to order
- **Purpose**: Dispatch order for delivery

#### STEP 5: Driver Delivers (OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED)
- **Who**: Driver
- **What**: Delivers order to customer
- **Action**: Confirms delivery and collects cash
- **Purpose**: Delivery confirmation

#### STEP 6: Cashier Verifies Cash & Completes (DELIVERED → COMPLETED)
- **Who**: Cashier
- **What**: Driver returns, cashier counts cash
- **Action**: Verifies cash amount matches order total
- **Purpose**: Financial verification and order completion

## Database Changes

### Updated OrderStatus Enum
```prisma
enum OrderStatus {
  PENDING         // Client places order
  CONFIRMED       // Cashier confirms order
  PREPARING       // Kitchen is preparing
  READY           // Kitchen finished, ready for pickup
  OUT_FOR_DELIVERY // Driver picked up, on the way
  DELIVERED       // Driver confirmed delivery
  COMPLETED       // Cashier verified cash/payment
  CANCELLED       // Order cancelled
  AWAITING_PAYMENT // (Legacy - kept for compatibility)
  PAYMENT_DISPUTED // (Legacy - kept for compatibility)
}
```

### Transition Validations
The system enforces strict state transitions:
- PENDING → [CONFIRMED, CANCELLED]
- CONFIRMED → [PREPARING, CANCELLED]
- PREPARING → [READY, CANCELLED]
- READY → [OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, CANCELLED]
- OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → [DELIVERED, CANCELLED]
- DELIVERED → [COMPLETED]

## Backend Changes

### New API Endpoints

#### Cashier Routes (`/api/cashier`)
```javascript
POST /orders/:orderId/confirm          // PENDING → CONFIRMED
POST /orders/:orderId/send-to-kitchen  // CONFIRMED → PREPARING
POST /orders/:orderId/ready            // PREPARING → READY
POST /orders/:orderId/assign-driver    // READY → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
POST /orders/:orderId/reject           // PENDING → CANCELLED
POST /payments                         // DELIVERED → COMPLETED
GET  /drivers                          // Get available drivers
GET  /transactions                     // Get today's transactions
```

#### Driver Routes (`/api/driver`)
```javascript
POST /deliveries/:orderId/start        // READY → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
POST /deliveries/:orderId/complete     // OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED
```

### Controller Updates

#### `cashier.controller.js`
- **confirmOrder**: PENDING → CONFIRMED (cashier reviews and confirms)
- **sendToKitchen**: CONFIRMED → PREPARING (physical handoff to kitchen)
- **markOrderReady**: PREPARING → READY (kitchen finished)
- **assignDriver**: READY → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY (assigns driver)
- **processPayment**: DELIVERED → COMPLETED (verifies cash)
- **rejectOrder**: PENDING → CANCELLED (rejects bad orders)

#### `driver.controller.js`
- **startDelivery**: Starts delivery journey
- **completeDelivery**: Marks as DELIVERED and records cash collection

- Driver physically returns with cash (STEP 6)

### 3. Financial Control
- Driver collects cash during delivery
- Cashier verifies and counts cash
- Discrepancies tracked
- Complete audit trail

### 4. Order Tracking
- Real-time status updates
- Clear visual indicators
- Status-based filtering
- Workflow progress visualization

### 5. Error Prevention
- State transition validation
- Required confirmations at each step
- Reject capability for bad orders
- Discrepancy handling

## Testing Checklist

### Cashier Workflow
- [ ] Confirm new PENDING order → becomes CONFIRMED
- [ ] Send CONFIRMED order to kitchen → becomes PREPARING
- [ ] Mark PREPARING order ready → becomes READY
- [ ] Assign driver to READY order → becomes OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
- [ ] Verify cash for DELIVERED order → becomes COMPLETED
- [ ] Reject PENDING order → becomes CANCELLED

### Driver Workflow
- [ ] See assigned READY orders
- [ ] Start delivery → order becomes OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
- [ ] Complete delivery → order becomes DELIVERED
- [ ] Cash collection recorded

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Invalid state transitions rejected
- [ ] Multiple cashiers don't conflict
- [ ] Driver reassignment works
- [ ] Cash discrepancies tracked
- [ ] Cancelled orders handled properly

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Orders
- Orders in PREPARING status will continue to work
- Legacy AWAITING_PAYMENT status maintained for compatibility
- New orders will use CONFIRMED status

### Database Migration
```bash
# Run Prisma generate to update client
npx prisma generate

# Schema changes are applied
# CONFIRMED status added to OrderStatus enum
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Accountability**: Each step has a clear owner
2. **Improved Cash Control**: Two-step cash verification (driver collects, cashier verifies)
3. **Kitchen Efficiency**: Only receives confirmed orders
4. **Order Accuracy**: Cashier review before kitchen starts
5. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every status change logged
6. **User-Friendly UI**: Visual workflow guides cashiers
7. **Real-time Tracking**: Everyone sees current order status

## Next Steps

1. Train cashiers on new 6-step workflow
2. Update kitchen staff on status changes
3. Brief drivers on DELIVERED confirmation process
4. Monitor cash discrepancies
5. Collect feedback and iterate
