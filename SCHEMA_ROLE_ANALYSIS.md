## 🚨 Missing Features in Current Dashboards

### Cook Dashboard Needs:
- ❌ Real order data from database
- ❌ OrderItem details (with quantities and notes)
- ❌ MenuItem information (to see what to cook)
- ✅ Status workflow (already has this)

### Waiter Dashboard Needs:
- ❌ Table model or table tracking system
- ❌ Link to create orders
- ❌ Today's reservations integration
- ❌ Table assignment for orders

### Cashier Dashboard Needs:
- ❌ CashTransaction CRUD
- ❌ Integration with Order.status = AWAITING_PAYMENT
- ❌ End shift report generation
- ❌ Payment verification workflow

### Driver Dashboard Needs:
- ❌ Link to Driver model (driver profile)
- ❌ CashTransaction creation for COD
- ❌ Accept delivery functionality
- ❌ Driver status updates (Available/On Delivery/Offline)
- ❌ Daily cash summary

---

## 🔧 Required Schema Changes

### 1. Add Table Support (for Waiters)

**Option A:** Add Table model (recommended):
```prisma
model Table {
  id          String      @id @default(cuid())
  number      String      @unique
  capacity    Int         // Max guests
  status      TableStatus @default(AVAILABLE)
  currentOrderId String?  @unique
  order       Order?      @relation(fields: [currentOrderId], references: [id])
  guestCount  Int?
  seatedAt    DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime    @updatedAt
  
  @@map("public.tables")
}

enum TableStatus {
  AVAILABLE
  OCCUPIED
  RESERVED
  CLEANING
}
```

**Option B:** Add fields to Order:
```prisma
model Order {
  // ... existing fields
  tableNumber  String?  // For dine-in orders
  guestCount   Int?     // Party size for dine-in
}
```

### 2. Add DINE_IN to OrderType

Currently only has:
```prisma
enum OrderType {
  TAKEOUT
  DELIVERY
}
```

Should be:
```prisma
enum OrderType {
  DINE_IN    // NEW - for waiter orders
  TAKEOUT
  DELIVERY
}
```

### 3. Consider Adding Order Assignments

For better tracking:
```prisma
model Order {
  // ... existing fields
  cookId    String?   // Assigned cook
  waiterId  String?   // Assigned waiter
  cashierId String?   // Who processed payment
  
  cook    User? @relation("OrderCook", fields: [cookId], references: [id])
  waiter  User? @relation("OrderWaiter", fields: [waiterId], references: [id])
  cashier User? @relation("OrderCashier", fields: [cashierId], references: [id])
}
```

## 📊 Recommended Dashboard Updates

### Priority 1: Backend APIs
Before improving dashboards, create these API endpoints:

#### Cook APIs:
```
✅ Already exists: /api/orders (basic)
❌ Need: /api/kitchen/orders?status=CONFIRMED,PREPARING
❌ Need: /api/kitchen/orders/:id/start-preparing
❌ Need: /api/kitchen/orders/:id/mark-ready
```

#### Waiter APIs:
```
❌ Need: /api/waiter/tables (if Table model added)
❌ Need: /api/waiter/orders (create with tableNumber)
❌ Need: /api/waiter/reservations?date=today
```

#### Cashier APIs:
```
❌ Need: /api/cashier/orders?status=AWAITING_PAYMENT
❌ Need: /api/cashier/payments (create CashTransaction)
❌ Need: /api/cashier/summary?date=today
```

#### Driver APIs:
```
❌ Need: /api/driver/deliveries
❌ Need: /api/driver/deliveries/:id/accept
❌ Need: /api/driver/deliveries/:id/start
❌ Need: /api/driver/deliveries/:id/complete
❌ Need: /api/driver/cash-summary
```

### Priority 2: Schema Updates
1. Add DINE_IN to OrderType enum
2. Consider adding Table model
3. Consider adding assignment fields to Order

### Priority 3: Dashboard Enhancements
Update each dashboard to use real data from proper APIs

---

## 🎯 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Schema Updates (Required)
- [ ] Add `DINE_IN` to OrderType enum
- [ ] Add `tableNumber` to Order model (for waiter support)
- [ ] Run migration: `npx prisma migrate dev`

### Phase 2: Backend APIs (Critical)
- [ ] Create `/api/kitchen/*` endpoints
- [ ] Create `/api/waiter/*` endpoints  
- [ ] Create `/api/cashier/*` endpoints
- [ ] Create `/api/driver/*` endpoints

### Phase 3: Dashboard Integration
- [ ] Connect Cook dashboard to kitchen API
- [ ] Connect Waiter dashboard to waiter API
- [ ] Connect Cashier dashboard to cashier API
- [ ] Connect Driver dashboard to driver API

### Phase 4: Real-time Updates (Nice to have)
- [ ] WebSocket for order updates
- [ ] Push notifications for new orders
- [ ] Real-time table status

## 💡 Key Insights from Schema

### 1. **Order Status Flow**
```
PENDING → CONFIRMED → PREPARING → READY → 
OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED → COMPLETED

Or:

PENDING → CONFIRMED → PREPARING → READY →
AWAITING_PAYMENT → COMPLETED
```

### 2. **Role Responsibilities**
- **Cook**: CONFIRMED → PREPARING → READY
- **Driver**: READY → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED
- **Cashier**: AWAITING_PAYMENT → COMPLETED
- **Waiter**: Creates orders, monitors status

### 3. **Cash Flow**
```
Driver collects cash (COD) → CashTransaction (unconfirmed)
                           ↓
Cashier verifies → CashTransaction.confirmed = true
                           ↓
End of day → CashSummary generated
```

### 4. **Delivery Assignment**
```
Order.driverId = null → Available for assignment
Order.driverId = driver_id → Assigned to specific driver
Driver.currentStatus tracks availability
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Review this analysis** - Confirm feature mapping is correct
2. **Schema updates** - Add missing fields (tableNumber, DINE_IN)
3. **Backend APIs** - Create role-specific endpoints
4. **Dashboard updates** - Connect to real data
5. **Testing** - Test each role workflow end-to-end

Would you like me to:
- A) Update the schema with missing fields?
- B) Create the backend APIs for each role?
- C) Update dashboards to use real data?
- D) All of the above?

Let me know what you want to tackle first!
